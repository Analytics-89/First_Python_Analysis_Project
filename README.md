# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my first Python project! I used this project to learn the basics of data analysis, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using a real-world Netflix dataset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)
* **IDE:** PyCharm (Windows)

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Content Split:** The dataset shows that Netflix has a significantly higher volume of Movies compared to TV Shows.
* **Global Leader:** The United States remains the top producer of content on the platform.
* **Data Quality:** I successfully identified and handled missing values in the 'Director' and 'Country' columns by labeling them as "Unknown."
